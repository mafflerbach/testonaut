    <p>comparisons are quite easy to implement, they are done almost automatically.
      In selenium there is the command<em>captureEntirePageScreenshot</em>. The second parameter specifies the
      imagefilename.
      If a reference image exists, it will be automatically compared with the reference image.
      You can find all Screenshot comparisons under the "screenshot" section.
      The first column displays the recently captured image. The second column displays the reference image.
      The third column displays the diff image, it will mark all differences in red
    </p>

    <p>By clicking on the X, the images will be<em>deleted</em>.
      In the first picture there is also a checkmark. This action allows you to replace the current reference Image with
      the image<em>recently captured</em>.
    </p>

      Screenshot comparison are automatic triggered, when a reference image and a actual screenshot exists.
      Screenshots are taken by the <code>captureEntirePageScreenshot</code> selenese command .
