            <h2>It's a Collaboration tool</h2><p>it has a very low entry and learning curve, which makes it an excellent tool to  collaborate with, for example, business stakeholders.</p><h2>It's a Test tool</h2><p>The wiki pages created in Testonaut are run as tests. The specifications can be tested against the application itself,  resulting in a roundtrip between specifications and implementation.</p><p>Great software requires collaboration and communication.&nbsp;<span>Testonaut&nbsp;</span>is a tool for enhancing collaboration in  software development. It's&nbsp;an invaluable way to collaborate on complicated problems -and get them right- early in  development. Allows customers, testers, and programmers to learn what their software should do and what it does do. It  automatically compares customers' expectations to actual results.</p><p>It is an integration testing tool. That means that it provides a method to automatically determine that your  application is working correctly. Not your beautiful user interface, with all its fancy CSS and slick Ajax calls, but  the stuff underneath, where the actual brains of the application live.  </p><p>  The goal is for&nbsp;<span>Testonaut&nbsp;</span>to operate at a level just below the user interface level, demonstrating that, given various  inputs to your application, the correct results are returned. In a sense, you could consider it an alternative user  interface for the application.</p><p>The best part of all - it runs on your (maybe) existing selenium infrastructure.</p>
